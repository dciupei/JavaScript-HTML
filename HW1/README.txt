It will take a polygon and decompose it into convex polygons, which in this case is triangles. The method that is used to triangulate the polygon is the ear clipping method. An ear is a triangle formed by three consecutive vertices. Identifying these ears is done by first classifying each vertex as either convex or concave. Convex vertices can never be an ear. This will be done until the whole polygon is filled with triangles.Run:	To run this program Node.js needs to be installed on the computer. A JSON file also needs to be passed through stdin that contains the x and y points of the polygon. stdout will put a JSON file that contains the x and y points along with all the triangles that were formed into the working directory. This output JSON file can be passed in the course website where it will draw the image of the polygon with the triangles.  Example:      node PolygonTriangulate.js < test.json > test-result.jsonFiles:- PolygonTriangulate.js- test.json- README

Description:

	In this program I created a a superquadric mesh with a 2D texture map with a shaded surface. The same HTML file was used from Project #3 but with the addition of a textured surface image. Most of the code was taken from Professor Cochran's Torus Mesh and Textured Surface source code. 

Run:

Open the torus.html file and that will open up in a browser displaying the Superquadric Surface. 

Files:
- torus.html
- torus.js
- matrix.js
- earth.png
- README.txt

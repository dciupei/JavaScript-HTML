Description:

	In this Program I created a 3D polygonal mesh, viewing and projecting, visible surface determination using a depth buffer, and lighting and shading. In the mesh a surface defined by extruding a circle along the path of a toroidal spiral. In the first part the mesh was done and in the second part the shading is added. Most of the code was taken from Professor Cochran's Torus Mesh and Textured Surface source code. 

Run:

Open the torus.html file and that will open up in a browser displaying the toroidal spiral tube
